If you have access to larger GPUs, go ahead and experiment by increasing the lora_rank, set bf16 to True, increase the size of train data, and also you can include a technique called FLASH-ATTENTION which accelerates the training upto 3x. If you have access to google collabs paid version and A100 GPU, you can experiment with above parameters."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-17T02:55:21.617507Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-17T02:55:21.617155Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-17T02:58:53.777956Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-17T02:58:53.777106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-17T02:55:21.617466Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"feb1d0ba5aef48c5b4ec14d557695ddf","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["config.json:
